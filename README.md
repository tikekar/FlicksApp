## User Stories

The following **required** functionality is completed:

- [x] User can view a list of movies currently playing in theaters. Poster images load asynchronously.
- [x] User can view movie details by tapping on a cell.
- [x] User sees loading state while waiting for the API.
- [x] User sees an error message when there is a network error.(Note: The UI is as per shown in the screenshot. I am not using the alertview, but it uses the tableView's background view to show the error message coming from REST api call when there is no data to show.)
- [x] User can pull to refresh the movie list.

The following **optional** features are implemented:

- [x] Add a tab bar for **Now Playing** and **Top Rated** movies.
- [x] Add a search bar.
- [x] All images fade in on the details page.
- [x] Customize the highlight and selection effect of the cell.
- [x] Customize the navigation bar and TabBar colors through AppDelegate.

The following **additional** features are implemented:
- Infinite Scrolling: Pass page number in the url query and fetch for infinite scroll.
- Used Container Views for the Now Playing and Top Rated tabs. This allowed me to create the Tab Bar in storyboard and still share the same FAMoviesViewController passing parameters regarding which list to load.
- In Movie Detials view, added the movie information view's panning and animation. (Panning gesture and animatewithDuration)
- Added SVProgressHUD using cocoapods for showing the simple progress bar
- Changed the TabBar background color and tint color

## Notes

Describe any challenges encountered while building the app.
- Creating panning (drag-drop) effect on movie details page was challenging.
